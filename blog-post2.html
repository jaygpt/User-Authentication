<p>First of all, congratulations for having cleared one of the most competitive exams of the country! You must have realised by now that the JEE counselling process is a very bothersome and daunting task. Everyone faces the perplexing dilemma of choosing the right branch at the right college especially because most students don't have any particular interest in any branch. But not to worry! Talk to as many people as you can and you will reach the right place. And after that, prepare yourself for an adventurous and exciting journey waiting for you ahead. We assure you the next 4 years will be the best of your life.

    With this article, we hope to resolve any doubts or inhibitions you might have about the BS Economic Sciences program at IIT Kanpur. We were in the same painful situation that you are in 3 years ago, and we are very glad we made the decision of choosing to study Economics@IITK.
    <br>
    <strong>A brief history:</strong>
    
    It was way back in the year 2005 when the authorities at IIT Kanpur and IIT Kharagpur, realising the need from corporate world and its research prospects, initiated a program in Economics for undergraduate students. Initially, the program was a 5 year integrated M.S course however later it was converted to 4 year B.S program at IIT Kanpur- Bachelor in Science or B.S. in Economics.
    
    Precisely, the Economics departments at IIT Kanpur and IIT Kharagpur were not independent departments. They were a part of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) department which includes other disciplines such as Psychology, Philosophy, Sociology and others. However, with the recent efforts of students and faculty, IIT Kanpur become the first ever institute among all the other sister IITs to establish an independent department of Economics now called as ‘Department of Economic Sciences’.
    
    Why Economics at a technical institute?
    
    It may definitely sound a little weird to you as to why technical institutes like IIT Kanpur are offering a Bachelor’s degree in Economics. We can imagine what's going on in your mind right now- I studied Economics at a very basic level and that too in 9th and 10th standard! I have been studying Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics for a whole of 2-3 years and now Economics...Seriously?
    
    To answer this, we have an excerpt from an interview of Dr. Vimal Kumar who is currently an Associate Professor at Department of Economics Sciences at IIT Kanpur:
    
    “Economics is basically a social science. However, it has acquired certain characteristics of engineering disciplines. Let me compare Economics with Engineering. According to New Oxford American Dictionary, Engineering is the branch of science and technology concerned with the design, building, and use of engines, machines, and structures. Of course, economists don’t design or built machine or any physical structures. However if you pay attention to the definition of engineering, you will see that the keywords used in defining the discipline are design, build, and use of structures. Exactly same words are used to describe the dominant methodology of Economics, Economic Modelling.
    
    IIT Kanpur has realised that the science, particularly mathematics, based education which forms the core for engineering education also forms the core of modern education in Economics. To capitalise on this synergy, IIT Kanpur offers a four year bachelor in sciences (B.S) in economics.
    
    Further, IIT Kanpur has realised that as our country is progressing, sound knowledge of economics is becoming more important and critical. Engineers need to work together with economists. For example, spectrum allocation cannot be done on technological basis alone, one needs a market mechanism to extract maximum possible benefit from the allocation for the society. The USA and the UK took help of economists to design market mechanism and were able to generate huge surpluses from their respective societies. ”
    
    To add, many internationally renowned technical universities like Massachusetts Institute of Technology, California Institute of Technology, Virginia Technology, and Georgia Tech have a humanities, arts and social sciences department which runs programmes in economics, among other subjects. These are offered for undergraduate, masters and doctoral studies.
    
    How is Economics at IIT Kanpur as compared to other social sciences institutes?
    
    Undoubtedly, you may have come across people arguing about why to take Economics at IITs when you have other specialised Arts and commerce institutes offering Economics for Bachelor students.Firstly, the Economics program at IIT Kanpur is of 4 years which is today’s need and is followed by other countries. However, most of the other Arts and Commerce institutes offer a 3 year bachelor’s program in Economics. Secondly, Economics in IIT Kanpur is more or less treated like a science discipline.
    
    The curriculum is highly mathematically oriented and emphasis is given on learning various statistical tools and techniques which are necessarily required in the area of Economics. Moreover, the course structure at IIT Kanpur is designed in such a manner that Economics students are substantially exposed to basic engineering problems which in turn immensely helps the students in emerging as efficient and better analysts and consultants.</p>

<strong> B.S different from B.tech?</strong>

    <p>A common misconception people have is that a B.tech degree from an IIT has greater value than a B.S degree. But the fact is that there is no sort of discrimination on any ground be it inside the IIT system or outside. IIT Kanpur offers B.S degree for Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and for Economics. Many renowned International universities also offer B.S degree in Economics. Your B.S degree is equally acceptable in India and at international level as compared to a B.tech degree. Coming to the market/industry scenario, the demand for Economics graduates is on the rise and the career opportunities are really good. If you have the aptitude the company wants, it doesn’t matter to them whether you are a B.tech or a B.S. holder!</p>

<div class="blog-tiltle_block">
<p>
    <strong>Course structure:</strong>
    
    The UG academic curriculum of IIT Kanpur is very flexible so as to give students the freedom to pursue their interests through courses from various departments.
    
    In first year, the courses taught are the same for students of all branches. They are basically introductory courses to all departments at IIT Kanpur, so you will learn linear algebra & calculus in Mathematics, mechanics & electromagnetics in Physics, life sciences & genetics in Biology, Engineering Graphics, Organic & Physical Chemistry, introductory C programming, one course from Humanities & Social Sciences (either from Literature, Sociology, Psychology, Art, or Philosophy) as well as an introductory course to Economics.
    
    In second year, you have four compulsory Economics courses- Level 1 Microeconomics, Level 1 Macroeconomics, Introduction to Mathematical Economics, and Applied Probability & Statistics. Along with these there are again common compulsory courses which all second year UG students have to do- Introduction to Electronics and Manufacturing Processes. You also have the option of taking open electives (courses from any other department that you like or find interesting) and department electives starting this year.
    
    In third and fourth year, you complete the core courses of Econometrics (crucial course covering statistics from basics to advanced which you need to know for data analysis), Development Economics, Level 2 Microeconomics & Macroeconomics, Industrial Economics, International Trade & Finance, and Indian Economic Problems. Apart from these, there are numerous departmental electives to choose from- Applied Game Theory, Bayesian data analysis, Introduction to Derivative Pricing, Economic Growth Theory & Practice, Economic Analysis of Law, Production Economics, Monetary Economics, Environmental Economics among others. You learn to use softwares such as MATLAB, Stata, EViews and languages such as R for working with data in academic projects (there is an option of taking up a research project under a professor as an alternative to an elective) or course assignments. Students are required to complete certain number of open electives, department electives, HSS courses, and engineering science electives in their four years of study.
    
    One thing different about the Economics curriculum as compared to other engineering branches is that it involves relatively less lab work. So Economics students have more time than students from other branches in their third and fourth year to learn skills & tools beyond the regular coursework, be involved in various clubs, hobby groups or sports at IITK, and enhance their profile. Also, this helps in preparing for other competitive exams like UPSC, CAT or preparing for placements. One can also give more time to research projects. All in all, you can see that the curriculum gives the students exposure to very varied fields so that they can explore their interests. Many opt for a minor degree in some other discipline such as Mathematics, Computer Science, or Industrial and Management Engineering to get experience in those fields (depending on what they want to pursue in future).
    <br>
    <strong>Placement scenario:</strong>
    
    To be frank, no IIT can guarantee or has ever achieved 100% placement. Please do not make the decision of opting for a particular branch based on its placement statistics; trust us when we say that where you get placed depends majorly on individual effort (the level of preparation for tests and interviews, the kind of courses and projects you take up) and not so much on the branch. Excluding core chemical/civil/electrical engineering companies, such as HUL & ITC which do have branch restrictions, “non-core” companies open their shortlisting process for most branches, since it is the aptitude that matters and not the branch. Few companies are open exclusively for Economics students, which means that we have to compete with students across branches for placements/internships. The placement is decent compared to other departments and as mentioned earlier, companies do not differentiate between a B.tech and a B.S. degree if you fit the skillset needed for their profile.
    
    Having a good understanding of Economics, in particular econometrics, helps a lot as the typical job interviewer for a non-core company does expect you to have more knowledge in that field than an engineering student.Students from Economics majorly get placed in Analytics (such as EXL, Walmart Labs, American Express, Capital One), Consultancy (such as Ernst & Young, PwC US Advisory, McKinsey & Company, Boston Consulting Group) and Finance (such as Credit Suisse, Futures First, Citicorp services, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Nomura, WorldQuant, M.H. Alshaya). Especially in the analytics sector, Economics students have an edge over other departments because they learn the skills needed to clear the tests and interviews along with their courses.
    <br>
    <strong>Career prospects:</strong>
    <br>
    1)   There lie immense opportunities after completing Bachelors/Masters in Economics. Our alumni and current students are performing extremely well and have left no stone unturned in almost every aspect be it corporate world, research or civil services. In this section, we note down the future career prospects that you have after completing a bachelor's in Economics.
    
        Job opportunities: As mentioned in the previous section, many of our alumni are currently working in renowned investment banking firms, consultancy services and analytics companies. An alumnus of Economics IIT Kanpur is also working in worldly renowned International Monetary Fund (IMF) and an alumna is working as a Research Assistant at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Moreover, a few of Economic graduates are currently working in renowned research labs such as J-PAL (MIT research lab) and Institute for Financial Management and Research (IFMR).
        Higher studies: There lie ample opportunities for higher studies in Economics. You can go for pursuing a Masters/PhD in reputed Indian and international universities. Recent graduates of Economics are currently enrolled in Master’s program at University of Columbia, Barcelona Graduate School of Economics, London Business School, and others. Some of them have already completed their masters from prestigious universities including MIT Sloan School of Management, Booth School of Business, London School of Economics, Yale University, Washington University, and Barcelona Graduate School of Economics. Our alumni have also secured full scholarship for pursuing PhD in institutions like University of Michigan, University of Toronto, Tilburg University, University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, University of California Irvine, University of California San Diego, and University of Wisconsin-Madison.
    <br>
    2)   Even at Bachelor’s level, a good number of students have been awarded summer research fellowships through prestigious programs including MITACS, DAAD-WISE, University of Queensland Research Program and Indian Academy of Sciences. Apart from these, students have been able to grab academic internships during their undergraduate curriculum in universities like ETH Zurich, Technion- Israel Institute of Technology, Virginia Tech, University of Milano, Michigan State University, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, IIM Bangalore, Indian School of Business. Economics students have also done summer internships in the Reserve Bank of India.
    
        Government Jobs and Civil Services: Without any iota of doubt having an Economics background definitely gives you an edge for preparation of civil services examination, For instance, Indian Economic Service (IES) conducted by UPSC is an excellent choice for economics enthusiasts. Post qualifying this exam you are eligible for joining various Ministries/ Departments of government and can provide your inputs on all policy-related matters, and their economic implications. You can also go for the Civil Services examination taking Economics as one of your subjects. Economics at IIT Kanpur is really proud that one of our alumni has secured AIR 12 in the prestigious UPSC civil service examinations 2016. Adding to the achievements, one of our alumnus is currently Deputy Director at Ministry of Finance, Government of India.
    <br>
    Another cool thing about Economics@IITK is that the student body interaction (across batches and with faculty) is pretty good. The department strength is 40 and with only 40 students in a class, most of the professors do know you by name and there is a very healthy interaction with them.
    
    In addition, ‘Econs’, the student body of Department of Economic Sciences at IIT Kanpur, is one of the most active student departmental body in campus and has been organising numerous events round the year for Economics students. Econs also acts as a bridge between professors and the student community and has successfully organised many leisure events like quizzes, sport activities, and discussions to bring together the professors and the students. It regularly conducts projects/case studies, discussion sessions, and workshops for Economics students.
    
    We hope that this article answers most of your questions and helps you in making an informed decision. All the Best! </p>
<span class="blogpost_list">Last point, I think we must think of making the branch change rules even more liberal. As we can see, they reduce stress across the board, give more students satisfaction of following their interest (even if that interest is guided by that awful thing called money). In fact, when many people argue that we should have program selection only after one year, I tell them that a liberal branch change policy can achieve the same result with less stress. </span>
